<h2 style="text-align:center;">Pybot/Theodora</h2>
<p style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;">
Pybot is a program that's supposed to get
<br />
you ready for the day and help you out
<br />
throughout the day as well. The first
<br />
version of Pybot, version 1.0, was just words
<br />
of encouragement to get you ready for the day,
<br />
now with Pybot 4.0 along the way, you'll be able
<br />
to give Pybot commands with your voice. Pybot 4.0
<br />
also has great text-to-speech to be able to communicate
<br />
with you as well.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;">
The evolution of Pybot has been tremendous
<br />
over the years. From being simple text
<br />
displayed on a screen with time delays
<br />
in between sentences, to personal
<br />
assistants with text-to-speech.
<br />
I am currently working on Pybot version
<br />
4.0, a personal assistant with text-to-speech
<br />
and voice recognition. Pybot 4.0 is planned
<br />
to be released anytime before September
<br />
of 2018. That doesn't mean that it will be
<br />
released in that time, it's just planned to.
</p>

<p style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;">
Pybot version 4.0 was released on August 17 2018.
<br />
It has amazing text-to-speech, voice recognition,
<br />
and more commands to get you through the day.
<br />
Please send us more ideas for future Pybot updates.
<br />
Pybot is now called Theodora, named after Empress Theodora
<br />
of the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Justinian married
<br />
Theodora and they became known as a power couple.
<br />
Pybot 4.0 was renamed to Theodora so people could
<br />
easily refer to it.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Calculators</h2>
<p style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;">
We don't just make personal assistants, we also make
<br />
claculators. In fact, Pybot version 3.2 has a calculator
<br />
programmed into it for simple arithmetic.
